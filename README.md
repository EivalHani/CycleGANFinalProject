# CycleGANFinalProject
   General Description

   
This trained model embeds a patient's medical diagnosis image within a container image, preserving the sensitive information's full medical confidentiality. The model is also capable of restoring the original medical image.
This trained model offers a secure and convenient method of transferring sensitive information. 
   Software Environment

   
●	Colab: Used Colab to execute shell commands.
